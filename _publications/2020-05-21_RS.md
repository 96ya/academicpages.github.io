**Abstract:** We demonstrate characterizing quantum evolutions via matrix factorization algorithm, a particular type of the recommender system (RS). A system undergoing a quantum evolution can be characterized in several ways. Here we choose (i) quantum correlations quantified by measures such as entropy, negativity, or discord, and (ii) state-fidelity. Using quantum registers with up to 10 qubits, we demonstrate that an RS can efficiently characterize both unitary and nonunitary evolutions. After carrying out a detailed performance analysis of the RS in two qubits, we show that it can be used to distinguish a clean database of quantum correlations from a noisy or a fake one. Moreover, we find that the RS brings about a significant computational advantage for building a large database of quantum discord, for which no simple closed-form expression exists. Also, RS can efficiently characterize systems undergoing nonunitary evolutions in terms of quantum discord reduction as well as state-fidelity. Finally, we utilize RS for the construction of discord phase space in a nonlinear quantum system.
