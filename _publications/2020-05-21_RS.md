**Abstrat:** We explore the possibility of predicting the properties of quantum evolutions via matrix factorization algorithm, a particular type of the recommender system (RS). A system undergoing a quantum evolution can be characterized in several ways.  Here we choose (i) quantum correlations charac-terized by measures such as entropy, negativity, or discord, and (ii) state-fidelity.  Using quantumregisters with up to 10 qubits, we demonstrate that an RS can efficiently characterize both unitaryand nonunitary evolutions.  After carrying out a detailed performance-analysis of the RS in two-qubits, we show that it can be used to distinguish a clean database of quantum correlations from anoisy one.  Moreover, we find that the RS may bring about a significant computational advantagefor estimating the quantum discord of a general quantum state,  for which no simple closed-formexpression  exists.   Finally,  we  show  that  the  RS  can  efficiently  characterize  systems  undergoing nonunitary evolutions in terms of both reduced quantum correlations and state-fidelity.
