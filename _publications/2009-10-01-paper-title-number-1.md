excerpt: 'Quantum  entanglement  is  a  form  of  correlation  between  quantum  particles  that  cannot  be  in-creased via local operations and classical communication.  It has therefore been proposed that anincrement of quantum entanglement between probes that are interacting solely via a mediator im-plies non-classicality of the mediator.  Indeed, under certain assumptions regarding the initial state,entanglement gain between the probes indicates quantum coherence in the mediator.  Going beyondsuch assumptions, there exist other initial states which produce entanglement between the probesvia only local interactions with a classical mediator.  In this process the initial entanglement be-tween any probe and the rest of the system “flows through” the classical mediator and gets localisedbetween the probes.  Here we theoretically characterise maximal entanglement gain via classical me-diator and experimentally demonstrate, using liquid-state NMR spectroscopy, the optimal growthof quantum correlations between two nuclear spin qubits interacting through a mediator qubit ina  classical  state.   We  additionally  monitor,  i.e.,  dephase,  the  mediator  in  order  to  emphasise  itsclassical character.  Our results indicate the necessity of verifying features of the initial state if en-tanglement gain between the probes is used as a figure of merit for witnessing non-classical mediator.Such methods were proposed to have exemplary applications in quantum optomechanics, quantumbiology and quantum gravity.'
